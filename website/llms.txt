# NEON-SOUL

> Self-learning identity synthesis for AI agents. NEON-SOUL reads an agent's memory files, extracts behavioral signals, promotes recurring patterns into axioms through cascading thresholds, and generates a SOUL.md that evolves with every run. Identity earned through evidence, not assigned by prompt.

NEON-SOUL is an open-source skill for OpenClaw, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and any LLM agent. It compresses thousands of tokens of hand-written personality into fewer than 500 tokens using CJK notation, giving agents 10x more context window for actual conversation.

The core pipeline: Memory files go in. Signals get extracted with source locations. Recurring signals become principles (N>=2). Principles that keep surviving become axioms (N>=3). The result is a SOUL.md that traces every belief back to the moment it was first observed.

## Commands

- `synthesize`: Run the full synthesis pipeline. Dry-run by default, use --force to write.
- `status`: Show current soul state, axiom counts, convergence metrics.
- `audit`: Inspect the full provenance chain for any axiom.
- `trace`: Trace an axiom back through principles to its source signals and file locations.
- `rollback`: Restore a previous SOUL.md from automatic backups.

## Installation

- OpenClaw: `clawhub install leegitw/neon-soul`
- Claude Code / Gemini CLI / Cursor: Copy skills/neon-soul/SKILL.md to your skills directory
- npm: `npm install neon-soul`
- Any LLM Agent: Copy the contents of SKILL.md into your agent's context
