# NEON-SOUL Skill

AI Identity Through Grounded Principles - soul synthesis with semantic compression.

## What Is This?

This is an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) - portable instructions that extend what AI coding agents can do. The skill is defined in `SKILL.md`, a Markdown document with YAML frontmatter that any compatible agent can read and execute.

## Installation

### Claude Code / Gemini CLI / Cursor

Copy the skill directory into your agent's skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geeks-accelerator/neon-soul
cp -r neon-soul/skill ~/.claude/skills/neon-soul
```

The skill becomes available as `/neon-soul` commands. Compatible agents will also auto-invoke it when detecting relevant tasks.

### OpenClaw

```bash
clawhub install username/neon-soul
```

Skills install to `./skills/` and OpenClaw loads them automatically.

### Any LLM Agent (Copy/Paste)

Open `SKILL.md` on GitHub, copy the contents, and paste directly into your agent's chat. The agent will follow the instructions immediately.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/neon-soul synthesize` | Run soul synthesis pipeline |
| `/neon-soul status` | Show current soul state |
| `/neon-soul rollback` | Restore previous SOUL.md |
| `/neon-soul audit` | Explore provenance across axioms |
| `/neon-soul trace <axiom>` | Quick single-axiom lookup |

See `SKILL.md` for full command documentation.
