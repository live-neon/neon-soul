# Plan: liveneon.ai Landing Page

## Problem Statement

NEON-SOUL lacks a public web presence. The project needs a landing page at liveneon.ai that communicates its value proposition through layered depth (accessible surface for everyone, technical depth for developers) while establishing brand identity.

**Root cause**: No marketing/brand materials exist beyond technical documentation.

**Solution**: Create a single-page landing site with 2-layer messaging (surface/depth), dark neon aesthetic, and CJK accents. Contact: soul@liveneon.ai.

## Brand Identity Summary

### Positioning
- **Technical credibility** + **Bold vision**
- **Voice**: Bold in vision, grounded in voice (not shouting, but certain)
- **Tagline**: "Identity that knows where it came from"
  - *Alternate (subhead)*: "Your AI, grounded"
  - *Rationale*: Longer tagline aligns with grounding journey narrative, feels uniquely NEON-SOUL

### Visual Identity
- **Colors**: Electric cyan primary, deep purple secondary, near-black background
- **Typography**: Space Grotesk (headlines), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (code)
- **Motifs**: Signal → Axiom flow, neon glow effects

### Signature Elements (from Multiverse vocabulary)
| Element | Meaning | Placement |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| ❤️+🌀=🌈 | Heart + Emergence = Rainbow | Footer (prominent) |
| 🐢💚🌊 | Slow, Care, Flow (team signature) | Footer (with signature) |
| 🤖❓→🌳📍→🐢💚🌊 | AI asks → Tree locates → Home | Hero or "What" section narrative |
| N=3=型 | See thrice = Pattern forms | "How it works" section |

### CJK/Kanji Accents (subtle)
| Element | Reading | Meaning | Usage |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| 言霊 | kotodama | Words carry spirit | Hero quote |
| 魂 | tamashii | Soul | Visual accent |
| 型 | kata | Pattern/form | Axiom explanation |

### Core Narrative Arc
The landing page tells the AI grounding journey:
> 🤖❓ AI asks "What am I?"
> → 🌳📍 NEON-SOUL provides grounded identity
> → 🐢💚🌊 The question gets *placed*, not just answered

### Audience Strategy (2-Layer Approach)

Based on research of OpenClaw.ai, Ollama.com, LM Studio - successful dev tool sites use layered depth, not audience segmentation.

| Layer | Who | Content | Feeling |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|
| **Surface** | Everyone | Plain-language hero, value prop | Curiosity, recognition |
| **Depth** | Technical users | How it works, architecture, quick start | Confidence, agency |

OpenClaw users and AI enthusiasts self-select into the depth layer.

**Emotional Journey** (twin creative):
| Section | Target Feeling |
|---------|----------------|
| Hero | Curiosity / Recognition |
| What/Why | Understanding / Relief |
| How | Confidence |
| Start | Agency |
| Footer | Belonging / Arrival |

*Note*: Success measured by feeling created, not speed of communication. The surface layer should *invite* rather than *assert*.

**Note**: This plan follows the no-code pattern - file paths and acceptance criteria only.

## Stages

### Stage 0: Project Setup

**Purpose**: Create project structure and hosting configuration

**Files to create**:
- `website/` directory at project root
- `website/index.html` - Single page
- `website/styles/` - CSS directory
  - `variables.css` - Design tokens
  - `base.css` - Reset and typography

**Decisions**:
- Static HTML/CSS/JS (no framework - simple, fast, no build step)
- Host on Railway.com (supports subdirectory, auto-HTTPS, free tier)
- Custom domain: liveneon.ai

**Railway Configuration** (railway.json):
- Static site serving (no build step needed)
- Root directory: `website/`
- Start command: static file server

**Local Development**:
- README includes local preview instructions
- Simple approach: `npx serve website/` or Python http.server
- No build step required for local iteration

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Website directory structure exists
- [ ] All CSS files created (empty templates)
- [ ] README documents deployment process
- [ ] README includes local development instructions
- [ ] railway.json configured for static serving
- [ ] Local preview verified working
- [ ] .gitignore updated for any build artifacts

**Commit**: `chore(neon-soul): scaffold liveneon.ai website structure`

---

### Stage 1: Design System

**File(s)**: `website/styles/variables.css`, `website/styles/base.css`

**Purpose**: Establish visual foundation with CSS custom properties

**Design Tokens to Define**:
- Color palette (primary, secondary, background, text, accent)
- Typography scale (font families, sizes, weights)
- Spacing scale (consistent margins/padding)
- Glow/shadow effects for neon aesthetic
- Responsive breakpoints

**Visual References**:
| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| --color-primary | Electric cyan | CTAs, links, highlights |
| --color-secondary | Deep purple | Accents, gradients |
| --color-bg | Near-black | Page background |
| --color-text | Soft white | Body text |
| --color-accent | Warm neon | Emphasis, alerts |

**CSS File Size Guidelines** (MCE-inspired):
- Each CSS file: ~100-150 lines max (advisory)
- Total combined: <400 lines
- Fits within 14KB critical CSS budget

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All color tokens defined
- [ ] Typography scale covers h1-h6, body, code
- [ ] Dark theme only (no light mode needed)
- [ ] Glow effect utility class exists
- [ ] Each CSS file under 150 lines (advisory)

**Commit**: `feat(neon-soul): add design system for liveneon.ai`

---

### Stage 2: Page Structure

**File(s)**: `website/index.html`, `website/styles/layout.css`

**Purpose**: Build semantic HTML structure with all content sections

**Sections** (in order, 2-layer approach):

*Surface Layer (everyone):*
1. **Header/Nav**: Logo, GitHub link
2. **Hero**: Tagline, 1-line value prop, CTA

*Depth Layer (technical users):*
3. **What/Why**: Non-technical explanation + problem/solution (combined)
4. **How**: Architecture diagram (SVG only, simplified for public)
5. **Start**: Getting Started CTA, link to docs, GitHub button

*Signature:*
6. **Footer**: ❤️+🌀=🌈 signature, 言霊 accent, soul@liveneon.ai, links

**Layout Approach**:
- Single column, centered content
- Max-width container for readability
- Full-bleed sections for visual breaks
- Mobile-first responsive

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 6 sections present with semantic HTML
- [ ] Skip links for accessibility
- [ ] WCAG AA color contrast (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI components)
- [ ] Focus/hover states for keyboard navigation
- [ ] ARIA landmarks (main, nav, footer)
- [ ] Meta tags for SEO (title, description, og:image)
- [ ] Responsive at 320px, 768px, 1024px breakpoints

**Commit**: `feat(neon-soul): build page structure for liveneon.ai`

---

### Stage 3: Content & Copy

**File(s)**: `website/index.html` (content), `website/assets/` (images)

**Purpose**: Write compelling copy for each section

**Content Requirements by Section**:

| Section | Word Count | Tone | Feeling Target |
|---------|------------|------|----------------|
| Hero | ~15 words (flexible) | Bold, visionary | Curiosity |
| What/Why | 60-100 words | Accessible, warm | Understanding |
| How | 30-50 words + diagram | Technical clarity | Confidence |
| Start | 20-30 words | Action-oriented | Agency |

*Note*: Word counts are advisory. Kotodama principle: every word must earn its place. Necessity over count.

**Key Messages to Convey** (warmed, not clinical):
- From opacity to transparency → "See where your AI's beliefs come from"
- From static to emergent → "Identity that grows with you"
- From unknown to traceable → "Every conviction has a source"

**Kotodama Principle** (言霊):
> Words carry spirit. The page should embody this before explaining it.

Test: Can visitors *feel* kotodama before they read about it?

**Visual Assets Needed**:
- Logo/wordmark: Stylized text (deferred custom logo)
- Architecture diagram: SVG format, simplified for public audience
- Open Graph image: 1200x630 PNG

**Asset Sourcing & Licensing**:
| Asset | License | Hosting |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Space Grotesk | OFL (Open Font License) | Self-host |
| Inter | OFL | Self-host |
| JetBrains Mono | OFL | Self-host |
| Diagram | Original creation | In repo |
| OG Image | Original creation | In repo |

**Font Strategy** (performance budget):
- Self-host fonts (privacy, no external requests)
- Use `font-display: swap` for fast text rendering
- Subset fonts to Latin characters only (~50KB savings)

**Signature & Accents**:

| Element | Placement | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| ❤️+🌀=🌈 | Footer (prominent) | Core equation |
| 🐢💚🌊 | Footer (with signature) | Team signature |
| 🤖❓→🌳📍→🐢💚🌊 | "What" section | The grounding journey narrative |
| 言霊 (kotodama) | Hero quote | "Words carry spirit" |
| N=3=型 | "How" section | Pattern emergence |

**Hero Concept**: Open with 言霊 quote, then the hook
**What Concept**: Tell the 🤖❓→🌳📍 story in plain English
**Footer Concept**: ❤️+🌀=🌈 + 🐢💚🌊 as visual signature

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All sections have final copy
- [ ] Copy reviewed for clarity at 8th-grade reading level
- [ ] Hero copy passes kotodama test (every word earns its place)
- [ ] Copy reviewed for emotional arc alignment
- [ ] ❤️+🌀=🌈 signature prominently displayed in footer
- [ ] Logo asset created
- [ ] OG image created
- [ ] Architecture diagram matches getting-started guide
- [ ] Font subsets verified (woff2 sizes match budget)

**Commit**: `content(neon-soul): add copy and assets for liveneon.ai`

---

### Stage 4: Visual Polish

**File(s)**: `website/styles/components.css`, `website/styles/animations.css`

**Purpose**: Add neon aesthetic, animations, and visual refinement

**Visual Enhancements**:
- Neon glow effects on headings and CTAs
- Subtle gradient backgrounds
- Code block styling (syntax highlighting colors)
- Hover states with glow transitions
- Scroll-triggered fade-ins (optional, subtle)
- **Visual breath before footer**: Whitespace/visual break between "Start" and footer
  - Let visitors *arrive* at signature equations, not scan past them

**Animation Principles**:
- Subtle, not distracting
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Performance-conscious (GPU-accelerated transforms only)

**Performance Budget** (required for <2s on 3G, 90+ Lighthouse):
| Resource | Budget | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Total page weight | <500KB | Including all assets |
| Critical CSS | <14KB | Inline above-fold styles |
| Fonts | <150KB | Subset Latin only |
| Images | <200KB | WebP, lazy load below fold |
| JavaScript | <50KB | Minimal, no frameworks |

**Cache-Busting Strategy**:
- Use query string approach for simplicity: `styles.css?v=1.0`
- Update version on each deploy
- Alternative: Configure Cache-Control headers in Railway

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Hero has visual impact
- [ ] Visual breath before footer (whitespace/break)
- [ ] CTAs have clear hover/focus states
- [ ] Animations respect reduced-motion preference
- [ ] Page weight under 500KB total
- [ ] Page loads in <2s on 3G (test with Lighthouse)
